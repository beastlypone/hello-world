# hello-world
where I can put ideas, and other things. This is really just to mess around and experiment.

I like to be creative I just haven't found what I can be creative with, I sometimes feel that I am just an empty shell full of uncreativity. Peaople say that I am creative but I see all of these brilliantly creative people in the world and I can't help but think to myself, "Your ideas are nothing comapired to theirs"... I think this, but I need someway too reasure myself that my effort is worth while... I haven't found that yet and I hope to find it very soon, because it is almost unbarible... should I stop trying too look for external things to do this? my mom thinks I should look within and just be comfortable with yourself. She belives that the only thing tyhat can make a person happy is themselves, I have tried to belive this but I feel; as if my mind is working aginst what I want to accomplish or that my stupid habbits are holding me back... I guess my issue can be solved with looking within, I will try and see if this helps me.

This is me trying to find ways to be more creative and have a more fullfilling life: change was made 02/11/2017
